.TH NO-NETWORKING 1 "%DATE%" "v%VERSION%"
.SH NAME
no-networking \- Limit network connections a process can make.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
no-networking
[\c
.B
\-lnp\fP\c
]
COMMAND [ARGUMENT]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B no-networking
is used to prevent processes from making certain network connections. The
wrapped process is launched with one of three supplementary groups whose
restrictions are dictated by iptables rules.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Option parsing stops at the first non-option argument, so in the common case,
"\-\-" is not needed between no-networking's options and the command to be
executed.
.TP
.B \-h, \-V, \--help
Show command usage and exit.
.TP
.B \-l
Allow connections to loopback addresses 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1.
.TP
.B \-n
Forbid all connections. This is the default behavior, but this option can be
used to override previously specified flags.
.TP
.B \-p
Allow connections to private addresses â€” loopback addresses, 10.0.0.0/8,
169.254.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 198.18.0.0/15, fc00::/7 and
fe80::/10.
.PP
If
.B
no-networking
invocations are nested, the most restrictive rules take precedence.
.SH EXAMPLES
By default, a command wrapped with \fBno-networking\fR will not be able to make
any outgoing connections:

.RS
$ no-networking ping google.com
.br
ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
.br
(2)
.RE

The "-l" flag restricts network access to loopback addresses:

.RS
$ no-networking -l ping google.com
.br
ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
.br
(2)

$ no-networking -l ping 127.0.0.1
.br

.RE

The "-p" flag restricts network access to loopback addresses and other private
addresses i.e. RFC-1918 private use networks, RFC-3927 link local addresses and
RFC-4193 unique local addresses:

.RS
$ no-networking -p ping google.com
.br
PING google.com (142.250.191.78) 56(84) bytes of data.

.RE

The "-n" flag can be used to explicitly disable all network connections if, for
example, another flag was specified earlier in the argument list:

.RS
$ no-networking -l -n ping 127.0.0.1
.br
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
